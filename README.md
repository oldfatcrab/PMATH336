# Chapter 1: Groups

## 1.1 Definitions and examples:

- Let $G$ be a non-empty set.
    - Def'n: A binary operation on $G$ is a map.
    - $G \times G \rightarrow G$
    - $(a,b) \mapsto a\star b$ or $a\dot b$ or $ab$ (notation)
    - A binary operation is often called a **product**
- Ex 1)
    - $G=\mathbb{Z}$ and
    - and $+: \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z} --> \mathbb{Z}, (m,n) \mapsto m+n$
    - or $\dot: \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z} --> \mathbb{Z}, (a,b) \mapsto ab$
- Ex 2)
    - $G=\mathbb{R}^3$
    - and $+: \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 --> \mathbb{R}^3, ((x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2)) \mapsto (x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2, z_1+z_2)
    - and $\times: \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 --> \mathbb{R}^3, ((x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2)) \mapsto (x_1, y_1, z_1) \dot (x_2, y_2, z_2)
    - but $\dot: \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3  --> \mathbb{R}, ((x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2)) \mapsto (x_1, y_1, z_1) \dot (x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is **not** a binary operation because the target space is not G=\mathbb{R}3
- Def'n (**Groups**): Let G be a non-empty set with a binary operation, GxG-->G, then G is a **group** if the binary operation has the following properties:
    - (i) (**Associativity**): a(bc) = (ab)c, any a,b,c in G
    - (ii) (**Identity**): \exist e \in G such that: ea = ae =a, \any a in G
    - (iii) (**Inverse**): \any a \in G, \exist a^-1 \in G such that: aa^-1 = a^-1 a = e
- Ex 1)
    - The integers: (\mathbb{Z},+) ~> this is a group
    - **HERE**: G = \mathbb{Z} and +: \mathbb{Z}x\mathbb{Z} --> \mathbb{Z}, (m,n) |--> m+n
    - Does + satisfy properties (i) to (iii)?
        - (i) Let m, n, r \in \mathbb{Z}, then:
            - m+(n+r) = (m+n)+r ? YES!
        - (ii) Identity of + is 0 \in \mathbb{Z}
            - because 0 + m = m + 0 = m, \any m \in \mathbb{Z}
        - (iii) \any m \in \mathbb{Z}, we have that
            - m + (-m) = (-m) + m = 0
            - => -m \in \mathbb{Z} is the inverse of m \in \mathbb{Z}
        - Thus, (\mathbb{Z},+) is a group.
- Ex 2)
    - The integers: (\mathbb{Z},\dot) ~> this is a group
    - **HERE**: G = \mathbb{Z} and \dot: \mathbb{Z}x\mathbb{Z} --> \mathbb{Z}, (m,n) |--> m\dot n
    - Does \dot satisfy properties (i) to (iii)?
        - (i) Let m, n, r \in \mathbb{Z}, then:
            - m\dot(n\dot r) = (m\dot n)\dot r ? YES!
        - (ii) Identity of \dot is 1 \in \mathbb{Z}
            - because 1 \dot m = m \dot 1 = m, \any m \in \mathbb{Z}
        - (iii) \any m \in \mathbb{Z}, the inverse of m with respect to multiplication is 1/m (if m != 0), but 1/m \notin \mathbb{Z} if m != +-1. So property (iii) fails!
        - Thus, (\mathbb{Z},\dot) is not a group.
- Ex 3)
    - G = {1, -1} set of 2 elements with the binary operation given by:
        - \dot | 1 | -1
        - 1 | 1 | -1
        - -1 | -1 | 1
    - Note that \dot is just the usual product in \mathbb{R} restricted to element in G. Then G is a group because:
        - (i) \dot is associative because multiplication in \mathbb{R} is associative
        - (ii) 1 is the identity.
        - (iii) From the table, we see that 1 is the inverse of 1 and -1 is the inverse of -1 ~> every element in G has an inverse.
- Ex 4)
    - (\mathbb{Q}, +) is a group (exercise)
- Ex 5)
    - (\mathbb{Q}\star, \dot) is a group where \mathbb{Q}\star = \mathbb{Q} \ {0}
    - Indeed:
        - (i) Multiplication in \mathbb{Q}\star is associative as in \mathbb{Z} and \mathbb{R}
        - (ii) 1 \in \mathbb{Q}\star is the identity with respect to \dot.
        - (iii) \any a/b \in \mathbb{Q}\star, we have that b/a \in \mathbb{Q}\star and a/b \dot b/a = b/a \dot a/b = 1 => (a/b)^-1 = b/a => every element in \mathbb{Q}\star has an inverse
    - Note:
        - (\mathbb{Q}, \dot) is **not** a group because even though (i) and (ii) hold, property (iii) fails for 0 \in \mathbb{Q}
- Ex 6)
    - (\mathbb{R}, +) and (\mathbb{C}, +) are groups
- Ex 7)
    - (\mathbb{R}\star, \dot) and (\mathbb{C}\star, \dot) are groups (where \mathbb{R}\star = \mathbb{R}\{0} and \mathbb{C}\star = \mathbb{C}\{0})
- Ex 8)
    - ({1, i, -1, -1}, \dot) is a group, where i \in \mathbb{C} such that i^2 = -1. here
        - \dot | 1 | i | -1 | -i
        - 1 | 1 i -1 -1
        - i | i -1 -i -1
        - -1 -1 -i 1 i
        - -i | -i 1 i -1
